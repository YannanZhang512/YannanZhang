# 我的其他作品和DIY   
**本页中罗列了我的部分作品和DIY，其中一些是我在高中时期利用课余时间做的，另一些是我在大学时做的。**   

## 高中时的一些小制作

+ **高压发生器**   
***这是一个可以产生1200V的高压发生器。在高中时代，我的物理老师希望我能给大家科普一下生活中的电学知识，为了像大家介绍日光灯的工作原理，我制作了这个高压发生器，它可以短暂的点亮日光灯，在那次科普课上，这个小实验装置取得了不错的演示效果。***

+ **100mW音频功率放大器**   
***This is a 100mW audio amplifier using some common NPN and PNP transistors. When I was a high school students, I liked piano music, I downloaded a lot and I used this small amplifier to amplify them and enjoy them.***

+ **A Digital Timer**   
***This is a digital timer. It can be used to control a fan or a lamp or something.***

+ **A 3V~30V Switching Power Supply Module**   
***This is a switching power supply that I used to power most of my DIYs. At that time, I don't have a commercial regulated DC power supply, so I made this. It's noticeable that I even made the inductor myself. I coiled the wire on a ferrite core to made this inductor, it works well!***

+ **A 3V~15V Power Supply Module**   
***This is another power supply module that I made. It uses a adapter as a power, it converts the 18V input to 3V-15V output. Since it has a adapter, it's easy to use.***

+ **A Solar Energy Harvesting System**   
***This is a solar energy harvesting system. It has a 10W solar cell panel, it can be used as a charger since it has a 5V USB output. It also has an adjustable output that can output a maximal 12V voltage. Besides, it has a overvoltage protection circuit.***

+ **A Audio Recorder**   
***This audio recorder can record 30s audio and replay it at any time.***   
![audioRecorder](img/audioRecorder.jpg)   

+ **A Static Detector**   
***This is a static detector, it can be used to detect objects that have static if you don't want to be shocked. It also can be used to detect the thunder, when there is a thunder, the needle will shake.***

## PCB Layout    
***The following photo shows some of pcb I designed, including phase-locked loop, rf amplifier, mixer, am receiver front-end and so on.***

## A 2.4G Wireless Transmitter and Receiver
***These are 2.4GHz wireless transmitter and receiver, it can be used to control remote devices or transmit and receive data.***

## A Temperature Regulator
***The temperature regulator uses a DS18B20 as a sensor, it have a keyboard and socket. When the temperature reaches the limit, the regulator will cut off the power supply and until the temperature falls below the limit.***

## Signal Generator   
***This is a simple signal generator, I made it when I was a sophomore. It can output sinusoidal wave, square wave and triangular wave with frequency range from 0.01Hz ~ 100KHz. The signal generator features DDS to generate signal, MSP430F5529 is used to control two pieces of DAC0832.***

## LC Meter   
***The LC meter can test inductor with inductance from 1uH to 10H, and capacitor with capacitance from 1pF to 1F.***   
![LC_Meter](img/LC_Meter.jpg)     

## Resistance Meter  
***The Resistance Meter can test resistor with resistance from 1ohm to 10Mohm.***

## Network Analyzer 1  
***This Network Analyzer is used to test the frequency response of a system. The testing frequency range is 1Hz to 1MHz.***   
![Network_Analyzer_1](img/Network_Analyzer_1.jpg)    

## Network Analyzer 2  
***This Network Analyzer is used to test the frequency response of a system. This one is different from the prior one because it must be connected to an oscilloscope to see the results.***

## Dual Power Supply Module   
***This power supply can output up to ±20V@1A.***
