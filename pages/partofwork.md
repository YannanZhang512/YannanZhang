# Part of My Other Works and DIYs   

## Something I made when I was a high school student

+ **A High Voltage Generator**
***This is a high voltage generator that can output 1200V high voltage. I made this because my physical teacher wanted me to give a lecture to all my classmates, and I used this to illustrate how a fluorescent lamp works.***

+ **A 100mW audio Amplifier**
***This is a 100mW audio amplifier using some common NPN and PNP transistors. When I was a high school students, I liked piano music, I downloaded a lot and I used this small amplifier to amplify them and enjoy them.***

+ **A Digital Timer**
***This is a digital timer. It can be used to control a fan or a lamp or something.***

+ **A 3V~30V Switching Power Supply Module**
***This is a switching power supply that I used to power most of my DIYs. At that time, I don't have a commercial regulated DC power supply, so I made this. It's noticeable that I even made the inductor myself. I coiled the wire on a ferrite core to made this inductor, it works well!***

+ **A 3V~15V Power Supply Module**
***This is another power supply module that I made. It uses a adapter as a power, it converts the 18V input to 3V-15V output. Since it has a adapter, it's easy to use.***

+ **A Solar Energy Harvesting System**
***This is a solar energy harvesting system. It has a 10W solar cell panel, it can be used as a charger since it has a 5V USB output. It also has an adjustable output that can output a maximal 12V voltage. Besides, it has a overvoltage protection circuit.***

+ **A Audio Recorder**
***This audio recorder can record 30s audio and replay it at any time.***

+ **A Static Detector**
***This is a static detector, it can be used to detect objects that have static if you don't want to be shocked. It also can be used to detect the thunder, when there is a thunder, the needle will shake.***

## A 2.4G Wireless Transmitter and Receiver
***These are 2.4GHz wireless transmitter and receiver, it can be used to control remote devices or transmit and receive data.***

## A Temperature Regulator
***The temperature regulator uses a DS18B20 as a sensor, it have a keyboard and socket. When the temperature reaches the limit, the regulator will cut off the power supply and until the temperature falls below the limit.***
