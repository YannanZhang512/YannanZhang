## D Flip-Flop
### Elimination of the output glitches
In SAR ADC, D Flip-Flop is often used to generate proper logic. Traditional D Flip-Flop is slow and power-hungry. To achieve low propagation delay and high speed, TSPC D Flip-Flop is used in this project. However, traditional TSPC DFF has the problem of output glitches, as shown below.
