# 关于我
![banner](img/banner.jpg)   
**Hello, My name is Yannan Zhang. I'm from China. I become interested in Electronics when I was a small child. My grandfather was an electrician when I was young. He stored all his electronic components in a drawer. One day, I found all that shiny small things and smashed them using a hammer. Since then, my fate was destined.**

# My Video Tutorial
Once I was a high school student, I was attracted by the electronic world. I wanted to learn how to program microcontrollers and how to build my own audio amplifier. But without a tutor or someone to guide me, I felt so painful to learn those esoteric knowledge. I understand the pain that a starter feel, so I'm trying to share my limited knowledge to help those who want to enter the electronic world but don't know how to do.   
**Below are some video tutorials that I recorded. These videos explain knowledge in a more practical way, not a academic way, which can help starters to enter the world quickly.**
