# 我收藏的电子“古董”
***I enjoy collecting all kinds of electronic things, especially chips, transistors, diodes, vacuum tubes and instruments. Some of my collections have witnessed the development of our country's electronic industry, even a small diode emits the scent of history.***   

## Instruments
OOps!   

## Integrated Circuits
+ **AD667, AD0809, AD1674, AD565**   
![AD667](img/AD667.jpg)  
+ **ADI's HAS-1202A**   
***HAS-1202A is ADI's 12Bits Ultra-Fast Hybrid Analog-to-Digital Converter. Its conversion time is 1.2us with an accuracy of 0.012% of F.S. Interestingly, it doesn't have a track-and-hold circuit, so it must be used with an external track-and-hold chip, like HTC-0300.***

+ **5G23A and FC3B**   
***5G23A and FC3B are integrated operational amplifiers made in China in 1977 and 1981 respectively.***
