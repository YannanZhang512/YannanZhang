Hello, My name is Yannan Zhang. I'm from China. I become interested in Electronics when I was a small child. My grandfather was an electrician when I was young. He stored all his electronic components in a drawer. One day, I found all that shiny small things and smashed them using a hammer. Since then, my fate was destined.
